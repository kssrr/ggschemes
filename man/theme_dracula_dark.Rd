\usage{
theme_dracula_dark(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to theme().}
}
\description{
These are the themes exported from ggschemes. The themes themselves simply 
apply the colors determined by the function factory to a theme template, so if
you want to modify the plot theme, you are likely better off modifying the
underlying template, or simply adding a theme()-call to your plot to override 
the settings made by these themes. Best used in conjunction with the matching
color scale.
